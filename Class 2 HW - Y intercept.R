#y intercept purpose:

#y ~ x or y ~ 1 + x describes the relation between dependent and independent variables in a linear model, with the dependent variables on the left side and independent variables on the right side. The ‘one’ symbol indicates an intercept. It is the value that the dependent variable (y) is expected to have if the independent variables have no effect.
